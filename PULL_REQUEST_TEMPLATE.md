#### Single-line Summary
**Today, _ and _ paired together. It took about _**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1.   <!-- TODO: Link our new script file in. --> Add articleView script link to index.html
  2.  <!-- TODO: Use jQuery to also add the author name as a data-attribute of the newly cloned article. Doing so will allow us to use selectors to target articles, based on who wrote them.-->  Added data attribute to newArticle jQuery object targeting this.author
  3. <!-- TODO: Add some coordinated colors to make the blog more distinguished:
           Use an accent color for all links, and remove their underline. --> Changed body link color to orange
  4. <!-- TODO: If the select box was changed to an option that has a value, we need to hide all the articles, and then show just the ones that match for the author that was selected. Use an "attribute selector" to find those articles, and fade them in for the reader. --> Added hide method to jQuery article object. Added fadeIn method to jQuery object attribute selector concatenation.
